## Why are you applying for Financial Aid? (150 words minimum required)
Hello, my name is Smail Abd El Madjid, and I am from Algeria, a developing country.
I'm requesting Financial Aid for the course Introduction to Git and GitHub because I don't have a secondary source of income, don't make enough money, and can't afford the full tuition at this point in my life and career.
Receiving financial aid for this course will enable me to gain valuable computer science knowledge. I've been looking for a job for a long time in order to earn money to pay for this course, but I haven't found one yet, and time is ticking away. Receiving financial aid will allow me to focus on my studies.
I want to put money into my career and education.
However, at this time, I can only invest my time in expanding my knowledge and progressing in my career, not my money.
Hopefully, this will change in the coming years because I am ambitious, eager to learn new programming languages and technologies, and eager to work and advance in my career.


## How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals? (150 words minimum required)

I have a strong background in programming, so I'm excited to learn git, and this is the first step toward me creating good projects that help humanity live more comfortably and solve major problems.
My primary career goal is to learn something new every day; I am eager to learn and advance in my field.
"Programming" necessitates continuous learning and improvement, and taking a course can assist me in expanding my knowledge.
I intend to expand my knowledge by enrolling in related classes and remaining active in a variety of professional organizations. I've noticed that many companies offer internships and jobs in related fields, and I'd be interested in applying and improving my skills to become one of the pioneers of version control.
There are many opportunities in this field that a candidate can pursue, but they must possess sufficient knowledge to pursue them. As a result, I believe that this course will provide me with sufficient tutorials and exercises to allow me to join some of the world's largest companies and demonstrate my creativity in this field.

## If you answered no, please help us understand why.?
Because the average rate of income in many developing countries is low, and there aren't enough personal needs for home, it isn't enough to take paid courses; we need a lot of free courses to learn and improve ourselves, as well as to help humanity and society.
